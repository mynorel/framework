# Mynorel Console Layer

The Console is Mynorelâ€™s command chamberâ€”a narrative interface for invoking flows, installing modules, and exploring the frameworkâ€™s philosophy. It transforms commands into guided experiences, making the CLI feel like a mentor, not a machine.

## Expressive Commands


```bash
myne install
myne philosophy
myne chapter:list
myne plotline:map
myne manifest
myne list
myne help
```

## Narrative Output

```bash
ðŸŒ± Mynorel has taken root.
â†’ Core, CLI, and Myneral templating are now alive.
â†’ Theme: myneral-dark
â†’ Begin your journey: myne guide

â†’ Chapters in your story:
 - home
 - profile
 - publish

â†’ Plotlines in your story:
 - PostPlot
 - UserPlot
 - CommentPlot
```


## Dynamic Integration

- `chapter:list` fetches chapters from Narrative in real time
- `plotline:map` fetches plotlines/models from Plotline ORM
- `manifest` shows all modules and philosophy using Manifest
- `list` and `help` show all available CLI commands
- Output is stylized and poetic via `StylizedPrinter`, with colorization via `SyntaxColorizer`

### Structure 

- Commands/: Individual commands
- Output/: Stylized printing and formatting
- Services/: Internal helpers like framework detection
- Contracts/: Interfaces for command structure

## Extending

- Add new commands in `Commands/` implementing `CommandInterface`
- Use `StylizedPrinter` for narrative output
- Integrate with other features (e.g., Chronicle, Author) for richer CLI experiences
