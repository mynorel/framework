# Mynorel App Skeleton

This is the default app structure generated by `myne new`. It is narrative-driven and tailored for the Mynorel framework.

## Structure

- `mynorel.json` — App config (Mynorel-specific)
- `composer.json` — PHP dependencies (includes `mynorel/framework`)
- `public/` — Web entry point (`index.php`)
- `narrative/` — App logic (Chapters, Characters, Scenes, StoryMap, Narrative)
- `prelude/` — Bootstrapping, pipelines, middleware
- `chronicle/` — Logging, error handling, events
- `resources/` — Views, themes, assets
- `tests/` — App tests
- `scripts/` — CLI scripts, onboarding, playground
- `myne` — CLI entry point for your app

## Quickstart

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   composer install
   ```
2. Run the CLI:
   ```sh
   ./myne
   ```
3. Start building your narrative-driven app!

See `onboarding.md` for more details.
