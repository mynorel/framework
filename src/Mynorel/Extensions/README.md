# Extensions (Side Stories)

Mynorel Extensions are "side stories"â€”modular plugins that expand your application's narrative. Register and boot extensions at runtime to add new features, integrations, or custom flows, all while keeping your core story clean and expressive.

## How to Create an Extension

1. **Implement `ExtensionInterface`:**
   - Define a static `boot()` method for setup, hooks, or service registration.
2. **Register Your Extension:**
   - `Extension::register(YourExtension::class);`
3. **Boot All Extensions:**
   - `Extension::bootAll();` (now integrated into Mynorel's core lifecycle)

Extensions can add services, routes, directives, or even new narrative metaphors. They are first-class citizens in the Mynorel ecosystem.
