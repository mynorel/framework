# Mynorel Architecture

Mynorel is a narrative-first PHP framework. Its architecture is modular, expressive, and designed for clarity and extensibility.

## Key Concepts
- **Characters:** Models and entities
- **Narrators:** Controllers and request handlers
- **Scenes:** Requests and responses
- **Plotlines:** ORM and data flows
- **Prelude:** Middleware pipelines
- **Scriptorium:** Service container and dependency injection
- **Facades:** Expressive, testable service access
- **Themes:** Narrative-driven UI and assets

## Directory Structure
See the main `README.md` for a full project structure.

## Extending Mynorel
- Add new modules in `src/Mynorel/`
- Register plugins via the ExtensionManager
- Add new directives to Myneral for custom view logic
