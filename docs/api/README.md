# Mynorel API Docs (Auto-Generated)

This directory is for auto-generated API documentation. To generate docs:

1. Run the doc generator script:
   ```bash
   php myne docs:generate
   ```
2. View the generated docs in `/docs/api/`.

## Philosophy
- API docs are narrative, poetic, and reference real code and contracts.
- Each class, method, and contract is documented with purpose and story.

*"Every framework tells a story. Let your code be the legend."*
